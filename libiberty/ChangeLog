	* Makefile.in:  Most hosts need strerror, but one or two don't,
	and they override these definitions in the host-dependent makefile
	fragment.
	* config/hmake-mach:  The odd man out on strerror -- it's supplied.
	* strerror.c:  New file.

	* strtol.c, strtoul.c:  Add strtol to libiberty, since Mach lacks
	it and bfd uses it.
	* configure.in, Makefile.in, config/hmake-mach:  Only configure
	strtol & strotoul in on Mach.
