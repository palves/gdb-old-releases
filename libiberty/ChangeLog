	* Makefile.in:  find-needed.awk does not fit in 14 chars.

	* Makefile.in:  Suppress error checking when compiling the test
	program, because Ultrix make/sh aborts there due to a bug.

Fri Nov 22 12:23:17 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Re-did how EXTRA_OFILES is used to be more useful.
	* README:  Explained how the auto-configuration works,
	and how to add new files and/or configurations.

Fri Nov 22 09:45:23 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* strtoul.c:  Avoid defining ULONG_MAX if already defined;
	cast a const char * to char * for pedants.

	* getopt.c:  Only define "const" after local include files get to,
	and only if they haven't defined it.

Thu Nov 21 16:58:53 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* getcwd.c (remove getwd.c): GNU code should call getcwd().  We
	emulate it with getwd() if available.  This avoids callers having
	to find a MAXPATHLEN or PATH_MAX value from somewhere.
	* Makefile.in, functions.def:  getwd->getcwd.
	* configure.in:  Use generic case for every system.
	* config/mh-{delta88,mach,rs6000,svr4}:  Remove.
	* config/mh-sysv:  Use default handling, just add -DUSG.

Thu Nov 14 10:58:05 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, config/mh-default: Re-do make magic
	so that for the default ("automatic") mode we only
	compile the files we actually need.  Do this using
	a recursive make:  The top-level generates the list
	of needed files (loosely, the ones missing in libc),
	and then passes that list to the recursive make.
	* config/mh-mach:  Remove obsolete STRERROR-{C,O} macros.

Tue Nov 12 19:10:57 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	RS/6000 host support (grumble).

	* configure.in:  Build alloca-conf.h file from alloca-norm.h
	(everything else) or alloca-botch.h (rs/6000).
	* Makefile.in:  Include . on the include path.
	* getopt.c:  Use alloca-conf.h.
	* alloca-norm.h:  How to declare alloca on reasonable machines.
	* alloca-botch.h: How to declare alloca on braindead machines.

Tue Nov 12 09:21:48 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* concat.c :  New file, like concat() in gdb but can take a
	variable number of arguments rather than fixed at 3 args.  For
	now, client applications must supply an xmalloc(), which is a
	front end function to malloc() that deals with out-of-memory
	conditions.

	* Makefile.in:  Add concat.c and concat.o to appropriate macros.

Sat Nov  9 13:29:59 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* config/mh-svr4:  Add sigsetmask to list of required functions.

Sun Nov  3 11:57:56 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* vsprintf.c:  New file.
	* functions.def, Makefile.in:  Add vsprintf.

Sun Oct 27 16:31:22 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, config/mh-rs6000:  Add rs/6000 host support.
	* Makefile.in:  Compile with debug info.

Fri Oct 25 17:01:12 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, and new files: dummy.c, functions.def,
	config/mf-default:  Added a default configuration mode,
	which includes into libiberty.a functions that are "missing" in libc.
	* strdup.c, vprintf.c, vfprintf.c: New files.

Thu Oct 24 02:29:26 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* config/hmake-svr4: New file.

	* config/hmake-sysv: Add HOST_CFILES and HOST_OFILES.

	* basename.c, bcmp.c, bcopy.c, bzero.c, getpagesize.c getwd.c,
	index.c, insque.c, rindex.c, spaces.c, strstr.c, vfork.c: New
	files containing either portable C versions or emulations using
	native library calls.

	* strerror.c:  Add copyright, internal documentation, etc.

	* strtol.c:  Replace hardwired hex constants with some more
	portable macros.  Remove illegal (according to gcc) cast.

	* strtoul.c: Replace hardwired hex constant with more portable
	macro.

	* Makefile.in: Move TARGETLIB and CFLAGS where makefile fragments
	can override them.  Add new source and object file names to CFILES
	and OFILES respectively.

	* configure.in: Add support for SVR4 makefile fragments.

Tue Oct 22 19:00:23 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Move RANLIB, AR and AR_FLAGS to where they can be
	over-ridden by config/hmake-*
	* configure.in: added m88kcvs to sysv list

Fri Oct  4 01:29:08 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Most hosts need strerror, but one or two don't,
	and they override these definitions in the host-dependent makefile
	fragment.
	* config/hmake-mach:  The odd man out on strerror -- it's supplied.
	* strerror.c:  New file.

	* strtol.c, strtoul.c:  Add strtol to libiberty, since Mach lacks
	it and bfd uses it.
	* configure.in, Makefile.in, config/hmake-mach:  Only configure
	strtol & strotoul in on Mach.

Tue Sep  3 06:36:23 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* obstack.c:  Merge with latest FSF version.
