This directory contains the -liberty library of free software.
It is a collection of subroutines used by various GNU programs.
Current members include:

	getopt -- get options from command line
	obstack -- stacks of arbitrarily-sized objects

We expect many of the GNU subroutines that are floating around to
eventually arrive here.

To build the library, do:

	./configure HOSTTYPE
	make

Please report bugs and fixes to "bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu".  Thank you.
