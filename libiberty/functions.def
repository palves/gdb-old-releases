 * List of function definitions that may *optionally* be included
 * in libiberty.a.  The function names must match the filenames,
 * e.g. bzero() is defined in bzero.c.  (While each file can contain
 * extra functions, do not list them.)
 *
 * In the default libiberty configuration, these object files
 * (e.g bzero.o) are included if and only if cc fails to find
 * the corresponding function in libc.  See config/mh-default.
