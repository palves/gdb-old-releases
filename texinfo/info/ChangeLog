	  the file name to look for is "dir".

	  nodes.h: New flag N_CannotGC unconditionally prevents garbage
	  collection of a file buffer's contents.  Used when "dir" is made
	  from at least one "localdir".

Fri Jan 22 11:36:42 1993  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* userdoc.texi, infoman.texi, info.texi: Fully document Info; create
	both online and printed manual versions.  "userdoc.texi" contains
	exactly the documentation for GNU Info 2.x.  "infoman.texi" is a

	the builder is not info_menu_of_node ();

	* m-x.c: New function replace_in_documentation () replaces \\[foo]
	with the keystrokes you type to get that command.  Now used in
	indices.c, info.c, infodoc.c.

	indices.

	* search.c (skip_node_characters): Rewrite "if" statement for
	clarification and conciseness.

	* session.c (info_select_reference) If the node couldn't be found,
	look for the label as a filename (i.e., "(LABEL)Top").

Wed Dec 30 01:57:50 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* New Version 2.7 Beta.

	* echo_area.c: Numerous functions now do something with the
	numeric argument.  Kill ring implemented, as well as yank and
	yank_pop.  Also transpose-chars.

	N_IsCompressed and display "zz" in the modeline if the node comes
	from a file which is compressed on disk.

Mon Dec 28 17:33:12 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* filesys.c, nodes.c: New member of FILE_BUFFER "FILESIZE"
	contains the size of file_buffer->contents.  finfo.st_size is no
	longer relied upon to read the contents of files, since the new
	function (filesys_read_info_file) can read compressed files.

	* filesys.c (info_find_fullpath) If a file starts with a slash (or
	tilde expansion causes it to start with a slash) still call
	info_find_file_in_path () on it so that we can find files with
	compression suffixes.

	* m-x.c: New variable "gc-compressed-files".

	* infomap.c: Put move_to_screen_line () on `M-r'.

	* nodes.c (adjust_nodestart): Don't set N_UpdateTags unless the
	node came from a tags table.

	* nodes.c (info_find_file_internal): If the filename being looked
	for doesn't start with a `/', then additionally compare the
	filename against the fullpath of the file buffer sans the
	directory name.  This can happen when selecting nodemenu items.

Mon Dec 21 10:07:18 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* session.c, display.c: Remove all references to active_window_ch,
	active_window_cv, cursor_h, and cursor_v.  The single function

	place the terminal's cursor at the right location on the screen.

Sat Dec 19 12:01:33 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* nodemenu.c: New file implements a few functions for manipulating
	previously visited nodes.  `list-visited-nodes' produces a menu of
	the nodes that could be reached by info_history_node () in some
	window.  `select-visited-node' is similar to `list-visited-node'
	followed by `info-menu-item', but doesn't display a window with
	the visited nodes menu.

	* session.c (info_numeric_arg_digit_loop): If redisplay had been
	interrupted, then redisplay all of the windows while waiting for
	input.

	* display.c (display_was_interrupted_p): New variable keeps track
	of interrupted display.  Used in
	session.c:info_numeric_arg_digit_loop ().

	* session.c (info_global_next, info_global_prev): Use the numeric
	argument passed to determine how many nodes to move.

	* session.c (info_scroll_forward, info_scroll_backward): If the
	invoking key is not SPC or DEL only do Page Only scrolling.

Thu Dec 17 01:34:22 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* display.c (display_update_one_window): Allow W_NoWrap to affect
	window display.

	* window.c (calculate_line_starts): Now takes a WINDOW * as an
	argument, and simply does the calculation, placing the results
	into window->line_starts and window->line_count.  It also handles
	W_NoWrap in window->flags.

Mon Dec 14 02:18:55 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* session.c (info_backward_scroll): Don't try to get previous node
	if the top of the node isn't currently being displayed.

	* window.c (window_adjust_pagetop) Use new variable
	"window_scroll_step" to attempt to control the amount which the
	window scrolls.

	non-zero the matched portion of the search string is indicated
	with ` and '.  Perhaps I should use `|' inst|ea|d?

	* echo_area.c (ea_possible_completions): Always build completions
	before checking to see how many there were.

	* info-utils.c: (info_concatenate_references): New utility
	function concatenates references.

	* Makefile.in: Add indices.c and indices.h to SRCS and HDRS.
	  Add indices.c to CMDFILES.

	info, and provides index searching capabilities.

	* echo_area.c (info_read_completing_in_echo_area):  Split off into
	separate callable function info_read_completing_internal ().

	* echo_area.c (info_read_maybe_completing): New function calls
	info_read_completing_internal () with non-forcing argument.

	* session.c: Rename down_next_upnext_or_error () and
	prev_up_or_error () to forward_move_node_structure (), and
	backward_move_node_structure ().  Implement new commands
	info_global_next () and info_global_prev ().

	* infomap.c (initialize_info_keymaps): Bind `[' and `]' to
	backward_, forward_move_node_structure () respectively.

	* session.c (info_menu_digit): Called with "0" as arg, select the
	last menu item.

	* infomap.c (initialize_info_keymaps): "0" calls info_menu_digit ().

	* session.c (info_move_to_xref): Take dir into account when there
	are xrefs and menu items in the node and we are wrapping
	backwards.

Tue Dec  8 09:57:58 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* info.c: Version 2.5 Beta.

	* terminal.c (terminal_insert_lines, terminal_delete_lines) Do not

	static buffer.

	* infodoc.c (info_find_or_create_help_window) Correct check for
	prior existing help node.

	* m-x.c (set_variable): Allow variables to have a list of choices.

	functions implement user-controlled behaviour when attempting to
	scroll past the bottom or top of a node.  New variable
	info_scroll_behaviour is user visible as "scroll-behaviour".

	* session.c (info_scroll_forward, info_scroll_backward) Call new
	functions for user-controlled scroll behaviour.

	* terminal.c (terminal_initialize_terminal) Set PC from BC not
	from BUFFER.

Sat Dec  5 00:07:59 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* info.c: New option "--subnodes" says to recursively dump the
	menus of the nodes that you wish to dump.  Menu items which point
	to external nodes are not dumped, and no node is dumped twice.

Thu Dec  3 16:11:02 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* session.c (info_error) Don't ring the bell if
	info_error_rings_bell_p is zero.  (info_abort_key) Ring the bell
	if printing "Quit" in the echo area wouldn't do it.

	* m-x.c (set_variable) New functions allows setting of variables in
	the echo area.  Currently, only visilble-bell and errors-ring-bell
	are implemented.

    	* general.h: #define info_toupper and info_tolower which check
	their arguments before performing any conversion.

	* search.c, echo_area.c: Use info_toupper.

Sat Nov 28 14:23:24 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* session.c (info_scroll_forward, info_scroll_backward) If at
	last/first page of the node, and the last command was
	forward/backward, do info_next/prev/_node.

	* session.c: New function info_select_reference_this_line gets
	menu or cross reference immediately.

	* infomap.c (initialize_info_keymaps): Add info_keymap[LFD] to

	area, along with a new function "info-set-screen-height".
	Compilation of this file and some code in others controlled by the
	Makefile variable NAMED_COMMANDS (set to -DNAMED_COMMANDS).

	* window.c (window_new_screen_size) Rewrite from scratch, allowing
	clean growth and shrinkage of the screen.  New variable
	window_deletion_notifier is a pointer to a function to call when
	the screen changes size, and some windows have to get deleted.
	The function is called with the window to be deleted as an
	argument, and it should clean up dangling references to that
	window.

	* session.c (initialize_info_session): Set
	window_deletion_function to forget_window_and_nodes.

	* display.c (display_update_one_window): If the first row of the
	window to display wouldn't appear in the_screen, don't try to
	display it.  This happens when the screen has been made
	unreasonably small, and we attempt to display the echo area.

Tue Nov 24 00:47:20 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* Release Info 2.2.

	* session.c: New functions implement reading typeahead and
	implement C-g flushing typed ahead characters.

Mon Nov 23 01:53:35 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* nodes.c: Remove calls to sscanf (), replacing them with calls to
	atol (), since that is much faster.
	(get_nodes_of_tags_table) Only check for "(Indirect)" if we
	haven't parsed any nodes out of the tags table.  Increase the
	amount that file_buffer->nodes grows to 100 from 50.  These two
	together sufficiently speed up the parsing process.

	* nodes.c: info_get_node_of_file_buffer_tags (),
	info_get_node_of_file_buffer_nodes (): Search the appropriate list
	and return a node.  This was simply a cut and paste edit to
	functionalize the code.

	* TODO: Remove suggestion for partial tag parsing, since tag
	parsing is much faster now.

Sat Nov 21 02:48:23 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* terminal.c (terminal_initialize_terminal): Declare and set up
	`ospeed'.  Turn off C-s and C-q processing.

	* session.c (info_show_point) When this function is called, the
	desired result is to show the point immediately.  So now it calls
	set_window_pagetop () if the new pagetop is not the same as the
	old one.  This means that info_prev_line (), info_next_line (),
	info_forward_word (), and info_backward_word () can all scroll the
	window if they have to.

Thu Nov 19 12:27:07 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* session.c (set_window_pagetop): Add scrolling to make this
	faster.

	* echo_area.c (push/pop_echo_area): Remember the list of items to
	complete over.

	* session.c (info_forward_char): Don't let point get equal to
	nodelen, only to nodelen - 1.

	rmembered display as well as the text on the actual display.

	* terminal.c: New functions terminal_scroll_terminal (),
	terminal_scroll_down (), and terminal_scroll_up ().  All
	implemented using "al" and "dl" termcap capabilities. (i.e.,
	insert and delete line).

Wed Nov 18 15:05:14 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* termdep.h: Only define HAVE_FCNTL_H if !aix and !ultrix.
