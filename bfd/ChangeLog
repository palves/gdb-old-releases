	* ../include/bfd.h (struct bfd_target): Added new field
	"align_power_min" which contains the minimum alignment for a
	section. This is used in coff_new_section_hook. The field
	insertion necessitates an update of all backends..

	* aoutf1.h jump table field inserted
	
	* archive.c(snarf_ar_hdr)(bfd_slurp_coff_armap) can now parse dgux style extended

Fri Jun  7 12:35:46 1991  Sean Fagan  (sef at cygint.cygnus.com)
 
 	* coffcode.h (coff_swap_aux_in): added else case to deal with
 	filenames less than 9 characters.

	* ../include/oasys.h oasys.c (oasys_archive_p): fixed so it works
	
	* srec.c: now allows any number of sections to be created in a
	file. Outputs addresses of the right length.

Thu May 30 15:30:10 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* bfd.c (bfd_check_format): Fixed problem where when a defaulted

	breaking a future test.

        *../include/i386coff.h : fixed typo in type field with size

	* i386coff.c icoff.c m88k-bcs.c ecoff.c ../include/bfd.h : Added
	support in the jump table for the swapping routines exported to
	gdb. Now gdb works with the 386.

Tue May 28 17:21:43 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* Merge in changes from gdb-3.95 release.
	Makefile.in:  Allow hmake and tmake files to add OFILES.
	aoutf1.h:  
	bfd.c:  support specific targets as well as searching.  When
	searching, take default target in preference to others.
	bfd.doc:  typos
	ieee.c, oasys.c:  Avoid using the "tdata" macros left of assignment.
	liba.out.h:  Don't hard-code file offsets; use N_ macros for them.
	libbfd.h:  Support specific targets as well as searching.
	opncls.c:  Support specific targets as well as searching.
	targets.c:  Search is short-circuited if default target matches.
	liboasys.c, libieee.c:  Undo bothner changes that make macros
	work to the left of assignment, but which depend on the
	representations of different pointer types being the same.

Fri May 24 18:56:52 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* i386coff.c: created.
	* coffcode.h: added support for 386. 
	* Makefile.in: added support for 386.

Tue May 21 08:58:58 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)
	(bothner)
	* opncls.c: Changed obstack_chunk_alloc use xmalloc

Mon May 20 17:12:17 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* everything: Removed sysdep.h from bfd.h and put back into files
	from which it was split out. Now 64 bit version is built with a
	-DHOST_64_BIT="long long" on the compile line.


Fri May 17 19:35:26 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	Changed all the [get|put][name] routines to use  [get|put]_[size
	in bytes].  

	Put in support for 64 bit work. Now two versions of bfd may be
	generated, according to the state of TARGET_64_BIT, one which is
	32 bit only, and one which is 64/32 bits. 
	Created new back end 'demo64' to test 64 bit functionality.

	Renamed some files to work on DOS.

	* archive.c: lint * bfd.c: prototypes and lint. * ecoff.c: added
	64bit transfer 	* icoff.c: added 64bit transfer * ieee.c: name
	chage, 64 bit transfer. * liba.out.h: Split out common code from

	be called b.out.c * coffcode.h: used to be called coff-code.h, now
	64bit ized. * demo64.c: 64 bit a.out back end


	


Thu May 16 16:02:07 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)
	from bothner
 	* libieee.h: Make ieee_data and ieee_ar_data macros usable
	on LHS of assignment, even when using old compilers.
	* liboasys.h: Ditto for oasys_data and oasys_ar_data.
	* m68kcoff.c: Add enum-to-int casts to accomodate old compilers.
	* newsos3.c: Fix definitions of SEGMENT_SIZE and TEXT_START_ADDR.
	* opncls.c: Define S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, S_IXOTH if undefined.
	* targets.c: Add declaration of newsos3_vec.


Mon May 13 10:03:29 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* aout.c: fixxed some of the problems with filepos calculation.
	(swap_ext_reloc): fixed problem with creation of relocs.
	(aout_set_section_contents): fixed filepos problem

	* coff-code.h: (swap_filehdr_in, swap_filehdr_out) add.
	(swap_filehdr) delete. Changed all the usage of bfd_h_put_x.
	(swap_aouthdr_in, swap_aouthdr_out) add. (swap_aouthdr) delete.
	(coff_real_object_p) cleaned up, added MIPS. (coff_object_p)
	cleaned up. (coff_write_object_contents) cleaned up. 

	* ecoff.c: Totally different. Now supports ecoff fully.

	* icoff.c: fixed problems in relocation callout.

	* libcoff.h: (struct icofdata) removed hdr structure from tdata.

	* m68kcoff.c: updated target vector.

	* sunos.c: (choose_reloc_size) added: (sunos4_callback) calls
	choose_reloc_size. (sunos4_write_object_contents) now calls
	choose_reloc_size so outputs relocs correctly, also calculates the
	size of the sections correctly.



Fri May 10 16:58:53 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	Merge Per Bothner's changes to modularize BFD a.out a bit.

	* libbfd.h, libbfd.c (bfd_generic_get_section_contents):  Add.
	* ieee.c:  Cast enums to int before comparing them, for brain-
	dead compilers.
	* coff-code.h:  Remove coff_get_section_contents, and use the
	generic one instead.

	* aout.c:  Derive new module from sunos.c, containing generic
	support code for all kinds of a.out files.

	* sunos.c: Remove all code that goes in aout.c.  Split out
	machine dependent followup in sunos4_object_p into
	sunos4_callback.  Use JUMP_TABLE(aout) for the transver vector,
	and redefine only the names we CHANGE, not all the names.  Drop
	the little-endian vector, and rename the vector as sunos4 rather
	than generic.

	* b.out.c:  Use aout.c routines for most of the work.  Slight
	changes for the new regime.  Remove close_and_cleanup and
	get_section_contents in favor of generics.  New transfer vector
	regime.

	* newsos.c:  New support for Sony NEWS, another a.out format.

	* ecoff.c:  Remove close_and_cleanup.  New tvec regime.
	* icoff.c, m88k-bcs.c:  Add write_contents to tvec.
	* ieee.c, oasys.c:  Remove close_and_cleanup, add write_contents
	to tvec. 
	* opncls.c (bfd_close):  Call format-dependent write_contents
	routine, if writing, before calling target-dependent
	close_and_cleanup routine (which is now always generic, I think).
	* srec.c:  Use bfd_alloc instead of malloc.  Remove
	close_and_cleanup and move code from it to
	srec_write_object_contents.  Add write_contents to tvec.
	* targets.c:  Remove a.out little vector, replace a.out big
	vector with SunOS vector.  FIXME:  Need Vax support again now.

	* libbfd.h:  Add write_contents format-dependent-vector to the
	bfd_target vector.  Supply a generic close_and_cleanup routine.
	* liba.out.h:  Handle the new aout.c split.  Add prototypes for
	all routines defined in aout.c.  Rename "sunos" things to "aout"
	things.  Add a few fields where needed for various formats.
	* Makefile.in:  Add aout.c and newsos.c.

	* archive.c, ieee.c, oasys.c:  Lint.

Fri May 10 12:34:48 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* ../include/bfd.h
	changed forward declaration struct stat; to reduce warnings. Changed
	comment on bfd_h_<x>_x.

	* ../include/m68kcoff.h, ../include/intel-coff.h,
	../include/m88k-bcs.h
	Now there are two incarnations of relocs, linenos and syments. One for
	internal digestion, and one full of char arrays for I/O. The original
	names have gone to detect errors.

	* Makefile.in, m68kcoff.c, targets.c
	Test new structure code with a 68k coff implementaion

	* coff-code.h, icoff.c, coffswap.c, libcoff.h 
	Fixed all the places where there were problems with the size and
	alignments of structures on disk and structures in memory. #ifed out
	all the code in coffswap.c, since it should be done using the target
	swap routines now.

Thu May  9 11:00:45 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* ieee.c (do_one, ieee_slurp_section_data): now supports the load
	multiple reloc command.

	* sunos.c (sunos4_set_section_contents): Made it so that sections
	are always padded to their alignment size.

Sat May  4 15:49:43 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* archive.c, bfd.c, coff-code.h, opncls.c, sunos.c, trad-core.c:
	Clean up types and such (saber C problems).
	* ecoff.c:  Clean up types and such.  Remove routines that are
	not used.  Fix up reading and swapping of shorts from files.

   Notes on bfd-0.5.2-patch1a, from Per Bothner:

	* a.out.vax.c: Remove two bogus "static" from prototypes.

	* ecoff.c: Got rid of lots of non-working junk (that had
	been copied directly from coff-code.h).
	Updated to be consistent with updates to icoff.c and coff-code.h.

	* libbfd.h: Added definitions for S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, and S_IXOTH
	if they're missing (as they are in (BDS-4.3-based) NewsOS-3).

	* sunos.c (n_txtoff): (Re-)Add support for sony. This is a kludge,
	but until the target_vector is automatically generated,
	it's as good as any. Note that the text offset is the only
	difference between NewsOS and SunOs (including magic numbers).
	(Most of the sunos_* routines should to renamed bsd_*
	and move to a bsd.c file. Then (and when the target_vector
	is automatically generated) it might make sense to create
	a separate Sony target.)

	* sysdep.h: Don't declare fread and fwrite. Causes trouble
	on some systems, and doesn't help on others.
	Similarly, only define X_OK if not already defined.

	* trad-core.c: Don't include sys/stat.h - at least
	on NewsOS 3, it has already been included.

Tue Mar  5 01:47:57 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* coff-code.h (bfd_coff_swap_sym, bfd_coff_swap_aux,
	bfd_coff_swap_lineno):  Export the routines that byte-swap COFF
	symbol tables if necessary when reading them in, so gdb can use
	them.  Add "bfd_coff_" to the names so they won't conflict with
	names in calling programs.  FIXME-soon:  if coff-code.h is
	included in two BFD modules, this will cause duplicate
	definitions; the routines should be exported to a separate,
	common, module (probably along with a mess of other ones).

Sat Mar  2 12:11:26 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	Improve modtime support.

	* bfd.h:  Add boolean mtime_set, and declare bfd_get_mtime.
	Remove #define for bfd_get_mtime.  Remove gratuitous comment.
	* bfd.c (bfd_get_mtime):  New fn, caches mtime, gets if not cached.
	BUG:  archive members still do not get correct mod times.

	Improve floating point support for core files.

	* sunos.c (struct core):  Change void *fpa_dummy to double fp_stuff.
	(sunos4_core_file_p):  Create a second registers section in the
	core file, called ".reg2", for the float registers.

Thu Feb 14 15:49:06 1991  Gumby Vinayak Wallace  (gumby at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* many changes to improve archive handling; found a logic flaw in
	  bfd_check_format which only just happened to work by cooncidence.

Thu Feb 14 07:53:16 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* bfd.c (bfd_perform_relocation): fixed to use output_offsets
	correctly.
	
	* bfd.h: changed type of udata in asymbol to void *, like it
	should be. Added bfd_reloc_dangerous enum member.

	* coff-code.h: Fixed it so that internally generated symbols get
	their values relocated correctly in all cases. Removed calls to
	xmalloc.

	* icoff.c: Not understanding the destination symbol of a reloc is
	not a failure any more, just 'dangerous'. This allows linking of
	b.out and coff images.

	* sunos.c: Cleaned up the way that ZMAGIC section sizes are
	calculated.


Tue Feb 12 13:25:46 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* sunos.c (translate_to_native_sym_flags): fixed
	sym_pointer->n_value so that symbols on the way out get their
	section relative values calculated correctly.

	* coff-code.h (mangle_symbols): fixed problem where tags were not
	being relocated for structs, enums, unions. Also various lints.

Mon Feb 11 19:52:26 1991  Gumby Vinayak Wallace  (gumby at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* archive.c (get_elt_at_filepos): system_call_error returned
	  incorrectly.

Sun Feb 10 23:18:40 1991  Gumby Vinayak Wallace  (gumby at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* Resolve the use of no_error and system_call_error.
	  The bfd library itself now will never set bfd_error to
	  no_error.

	  The code still needs to be combed to make sure all the error
	  codes are correct.  I suspect they are not always set correctly.

	* The names of all the messages have _ prepended because the sun
	  bundled compiler can't distinguish from a macro which takes an
	  argument and the same identifier in a non-macro context.

	* The reason for the above being that entry points which used to
	  be trampoline functions are now just macros which expand to a
	  direct call through the bfd's xfer vector.

	* (../include/intel-coff.h) F_AR32WR: fix this constant.  Why
	  must gas have its own version of everything (the gas version
	  had the correct value)

Tue Feb  5 11:46:53 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* b.out.c: Added patches supplied by chrisb@mipon2.intel.com to
	properly support i960 architecture and output correct reloc stuff.

	* bfd.h: added prototype for bfd_printable_arch_mach, added
	BFD_FAIL

	* coff-code.h: Applied patches from chrisb to support i960
	architecture, zero relocs and swap them correcly and conditionally
	compiled the timestamp.

	* sunos.c: Made the default section alignment 2^3 so that doubles
	are done properly. Fixed the same reloc bug that was in b.out.c

	* sysdep.h: Now compiles on a Posix box

Wed Jan 30 21:36:26 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* icoff.c:  Fix comment on big-endian version.
	* coff-code.h:  Make HAS_RELOC really work (it's backwards from
	F_RELFLG).  Set F_AR32WR in output files if little endian
	architecture.

Tue Jan 29 20:56:10 PST 1991 steve@cygnus.com

Mon Jan 21 11:53:51 PST 1991 steve@cygnus.com
	
	* bfd.h	changed name of alignment entry in sec_struct to

Wed Jan 16 01:55:53 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at rtl)

	* ChangeLog:  Started ChangeLog for BFD.
	* ToDo:  Create file for suggestions.

	* Makefile:  Support easy loading into Saber C.
	Add dependencies for icoff.o and bcs88kcoff.o.
	Rename coff.c to coff-code.h.  Change callers.

	* bfd.c (bfd_check_format):  Allow the check_format routines
	to return the desired target vector, rather than just a Boolean.
	bfd.h (bfd_check_format):  Change function pointer return type.
	archive.c (bfd_generic_archive_p):  change callee.
	b.out.c (b_out_little_object_p, b_out_big_object_p,
	b_out_real_object_p):  change callee.
	libbfd.c (_bfd_dummy_target):  Dummy routine replacing bfd_false
	in check_format transfer vectors that need a filler.
	libbfd.h (bfd_generic_archive_p, _bfd_dummy_target):  Fix decls.
	bcs88kcoff.c:  change callee.
	coff-code.h (coff_real_object_p, coff_big_object_p):  change callee.
	icoff.c:  change callee.
	sunos.c (sunos4_object_p, sunos4_core_file_p):  change callee.

	* libbfd.c (zalloc):  It should actually zero the storage!
	This was commented out for some reason.

	* libbfd.h:  Add malloc, xmalloc, memcpy, and fatal decls.
	This is so callers can avoid <stdlib.h> which doesn't exist
	on older systems.

	* bfd.c (map_over_sections):  Add debugging code, since I
	noticed the section count for sunos core files was bad, but only
	GDB had detected the problem.

	as typedefs for them.  Remove obsolete
	bfd_get_section_lineno_size.

	* cache.c:  Make the "fdopen" support work.  Keep better track
	of how many files are open.  Centralize the opening of files
	and be sure bfd_open[rw] actually try to open the file.  Evade
	linked list initialization problems.

	* b.out.c, coff-code.h, opncls.c, sunos.c:  lint.

	* coff-code.h (coff_slurp_symbol_table):  Null-terminate symtab names.

	(bfd_openr, bfd_openw):  Actually open the file, give error now.
	
	* sunos.c (sunos4_core_file_p):  Set section count.
	(sunos4_set_section_linenos, stab_names, fprint_name):  Eliminiate
	obsolete definitions.
