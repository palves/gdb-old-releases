#
# Test basic opaque structure handling (statically).
# The ordering of the tests is significant.  We first try the things that
# might fail if gdb fails to connect the uses of opaque structures to
# the actual opaque structure definition.

# When we start up, gdb sets the file containing main() as the current
# source file.  The actual structure foo is defined in a different file.
# A pointer (foop) to an instance of the opaque struct is defined in the same
# source file as main().  Ensure that gdb correctly "connected" the definition
# in the other file with the pointer to the opaque struct in the file containing
# "foop".

# Define a procedure to set up an xfail for all targets that do not support
# this sort of cross reference.
# Any target gcc that has a DBX_NO_XREFS definition in its config file will
# not support it.
# XCOFF does not seem to support it either.  See the very end of gcc/xcoffout.h.
# Native alpha ecoff doesn't support it either.
# I don't think this type of cross reference works for any COFF target
# either.
