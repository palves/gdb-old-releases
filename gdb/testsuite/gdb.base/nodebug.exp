	# The exact format for some of this output is not necessarily
	# ideal, particularly interpreting "p top" requires a fair bit of
	# savvy about gdb's workings and the meaning of the "{}"
	# construct.  So the details maybe could be tweaked.  But the
	# basic purpose should be maintained, which is (a) users should be
	# able to interact with these variables with some care (they have
	# to know how to interpret them according to their real type,
	# since gdb doesn't know the type), but (b) users should be able
	# to detect that gdb does not know the type, rather than just
	# being told they are ints or functions returning int like old
	# versions of gdb used to do.

	# On alpha (and other ecoff systems, even stabs in ecoff) GCC
	# puts out stProc and related symbols which cause GDB to think
	# it knows the type.  GDB probably could be fixed to do
	# better, but for now xfail these tests.  Irix5, even though
	# it is ELF, counts as "ecoff" because gcc puts out a .mdebug
	# section even without -g.  Personally, I think that is pretty
	# dubious, but maybe dbx requires it.
