 *	Dynamically loads a binary code file into memory and returns
 *	the addresses of two procedures within that file, if they
 *	are defined.
 *
 * Results:
 *	A standard Tcl completion code.  If an error occurs, an error
 *	message is left in interp->result.  *proc1Ptr and *proc2Ptr
 *	are filled in with the addresses of the symbols given by
 *	*sym1 and *sym2, or NULL if those symbols can't be found.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	New code suddenly appears in memory.
