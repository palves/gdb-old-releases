.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure may be invoked to use the Tk event management functions
without the rest of Tk (e.g., in applications that do not have access
to a display).
\fBTk_EventInit\fR creates the \fBafter\fR and \fBfileevent\fR commands
in \fIinterp\fR.
It also creates versions of the \fBtkwait\fR and \fBupdate\fR commands
with reduced functionality:  the \fBtkwait\fR command supports only
the \fBvariable\fR option, not \fBvisibility\fR or \fBwindow\fR,
and \fBupdate\fR does not check for X events.
\fBTk_EventInit\fR always returns \fBTCL_OK\fR to signal that it
completed successfully.
.PP
The event-management procedures in Tk are divided into two
groups, those that can be used stand-alone and those that
require the full Tk library to be present.
The following procedures may be used stand-alone:
\fBTk_CreateFileHandler\fR, \fBTk_CreateFileHandler2\fR,
\fBTk_DeleteFileHandler\fR, \fBTk_CreateTimerHandler\fR,
\fBTk_DeleteTimerHandler\fR, \fBTk_DoWhenIdle\fR, \fBTk_CancelIdleCall\fR,
\fBTk_DoOneEvent\fR, \fBTk_Sleep\fR, and \fBTk_BackgroundError\fR.
Note that \fBTk_MainLoop\fR cannot be used without the full Tk library,
since it checks to see if windows are still open.
If an application uses the event procedures stand-alone, it must
include its own main loop that invokes \fBTk_DoOneEvent\fR repeatedly.
.PP
\fBTk_EventInit\fR is typically called from an application's
\fBTcl_AppInit\fR procedure;  it should not be invoked in applications
that use the full Tk library (e.g., those that have already invoked
\fBTk_CreateMainWindow\fR).
However, it is OK for an application to start up using \fBTk_EventInit\fR,
compute without X for a while, and later invoke \fBTk_CreateMainWindow\fR.
When \fBTk_CreateMainWindow\fR is invoked, the full suite of windowing
Tcl commands will become available, and the full-blown versions of
\fBtkwait\fR and \fBupdate\fR will replace the abridged versions
created with \fBTk_EventInit\fR.
