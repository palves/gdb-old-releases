	* Makefile.in (install): Don't check to see if tooldir exists.
	Make $r(tooldi) and $(tooldir)/bin.

Mon Jun  3 12:33:38 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (end.h): Use explicit ./ when running end.

Sun May 19 21:05:31 1996  Rob Savoye  <rob@chinadoll.cygnus.com>

	* func.c(bfd_load): Don't try to print the filename if the pfbd is
	NULL.
	* interf.c(sim_load): Pass the whole string, not just the first
	byte.

Version 2.1 26-02-96
--------------------
 
* Fixed bug in "go" command.
 
version 2.0 05-02-96
--------------------

* Fixed bug in interrupt force register (erc32.c).

* Change file load function to use bfd_openr.

* SIS should now be endian independent.

version 1.8 24-11-95
--------------------

* Fixed FPU timing - some sequences of FPU instructions did not calculate
  the resource dependencies right.

* Corrected STDFQ when qne = 0 (again!). The ftt is set to sequence_error
  but no FPU trap is generated.

version 1.7.1 31-10-95
--------------------

* Corrected STDFQ when qne = 0. Now, a trap is immidiately generated but
  the FPU stays in execute mode.

* Corrected JMPL and RETT timing (these instructions takes two cycles).


version 1.7 25-10-95
--------------------

* Interrupt during annuled instruction corrupted return address - fixed.


version 1.6.2 25-10-95
--------------------

* Added -DFAST_UART to Makefile
 

version 1.6.1 24-10-95
--------------------
 
* Fixed bug in STDFQ which caused bus error


version 1.6 02-10-95
--------------------
 
* Modified srt0.s to include code that initiates registers in IU and FPU
  and initializes the data segment. The simulator 'load' command does not
  longer initialize the data segment!

* Corrected MEC timer operation; scalers now divide the frequency by 
  (scaler_value + 1).

* MEC breakpoints are not checked during store operation


version 1.5 14-09-95
--------------------

* Fixed some bugs in the cycle counting for IU & FPU instructions.

* Fixed bug that allowed an annuled instruction to cause memory exception.

* The *ws parameter in mem.c should now contain the number of waitstates
  required by the memory access (was total number of cycles).

* The supplied srt0.s now clears the BSS (thanks Joel).

version 1.4 22-08-95
--------------------

* Added a '-g' switch to enable/disable the GNU readline(), which cause
some problems on solaris 2.x machines.

* Enabled MEC watchpoint and breakpoint function to mem.c. Performance 
may suffer a bit ...

NOTE: The UARTs are now connected to /dev/ttypc and /dev/ttypd.

version 1.3 26-07-95
--------------------

* Fixed bug in mulscc instruction (how could that ever have worked?)

* Fixed bug in UART B (flushed characters on UART A), thanks Paul.

version 1.2 13-07-95
--------------------

* Fixed bug in interrupt handling (wrong interrupt selected when more that
one interrupt pending)

* Fixed updating of condition codes during logical instructions (carry and
overflow were not reset)

* Fixed bug in WRTBR (tt field was wrongly over-written)

version 1.1 07-07-95
--------------------

* Fixed several bugs in the interrupt handler and callback routines.
