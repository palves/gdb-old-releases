/* This is a magical hack for finding, automatically,
   all the files that are linked together
   and calling an initialization function in each one
   without requiring the main file to know which other
   files there are.

   Call initialize_all_files to run the initialization functions
   of all the files.  Each initialization function can enter
   the commands of its file into a global data base so that the
   contents of the file can be used.

   The files to be found must follow this file.  Each of them
   must start START_FILE, before any other functions,
   and end with END_FILE, after any other functions.
   These macros are defined in initialize.h.
   In addition, each file must contain a function named
   `initialize', which will be called with no arguments.

   After the files to be found must come the file `lastfile'
   which ends the chain of calls.  */
